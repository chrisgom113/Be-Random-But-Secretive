# Be-Random-But-Secretive

## Description

As with the rest of the class, I was provided with starter code that included html, css, and javascript files. The task was to both debug AND generate the needed code required to complete the functionality of the "random password generator" wihin the parameters of the Acceptance Criteria that fufills the User Story.

This task required me to take an extreme and tumultous deep dive into the foundations of Javascript language, incorporating the points and data that were acquired during lectures, as well as using the resources available in developer.mozilla.org (and various other Google-related sites). Simply put, this was NOT an easy task. 

To make this thing work, it required meticulous creation of if/else logical conditions, 'var' creations with various nested levels of use, and very 'meta' function delcaration and var expressions to achieve the final result. To add to this, window prompts were required in order to collect data while also creating an interactive experience from the user. Specific code was needed to incorporate the user's data inputs into the final result.

The biggest takeaway from this is that when developing Javascript files, there are a few major points that need to be consistently paid attention to:

1. Always test your code as you go. You don't want to end up with 100 lines of code that is riddled with errors in syntax, improper language use, or anything else that prevents you from getting it right. Much better to test each new line or function in the console before moving on. This is crucial

2. The order of objects, functions, moderators, etc. matters a LOT. I learned how to be careful with where and "when" I place lines of code.

and finally....

3. Commit!  I wasn't able to revert back to previous versions of my code after going down rabbit holes of trying this or that. Reverting to earlier versions would through consistent and descriptive commits would have saved me a lot of time!

In the end, although it wasn't explicit within the acceptance criteria that the HTML and/or CSS code needed to be changed or enhanced, I still went ahead and messed with the coloring for my own personal preference. THe page is essentiallyu 99% of what the CSS was before in the layout and styling. I just added a few colors.

See Acceptance Criteria below for details:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
